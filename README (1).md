# Memory Card Game

This is a simple memory card matching game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of a grid of cards, each with an image face-down. The objective of the game is to flip pairs of cards and match them with their corresponding pairs.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How to Play

1. Click on a card to flip it and reveal the image.
2. Try to find matching pairs by clicking on another card.
3. If the two flipped cards match, they will stay face up. Otherwise, they will be flipped back face down.
4. Continue flipping cards and matching pairs until all pairs are found.
5. The game ends when all pairs have been matched.

## Game Logic

The game logic is implemented using JavaScript. The main components of the game logic are:

- Shuffling the cards to ensure randomness.
- Creating the game board with cards and event listeners.
- Flipping cards and checking for matches.
- Tracking the number of matches made to determine the win condition.

## Technologies Used
